### _INPUT PROCESSING_
- background
    - SDL maintains a queue saving messages from operation system
    - the messages in the queue may or may not be about input, so you should use `switch()` or else for filtering
- `SDL_PollEvent()`
    - if there is event(s) in the queue, returns `true` and assigns event value into parameter
    - otherwise, just returns `false`
    - as a queue, the event assigned is removed and next event will be located in head

### _DELTA TIME_
- means the interval between last frame and current frame
- in other words, the game has passed for delta time from last frame

### _EXERCISE 1.1_
- making the Pong for 2 players
- replacing right wall to second paddle
- separating input keys for each player
- checking collision with second paddle

### _EXERCISE 1.2_
- making the Pong for multiple balls
- maintaining balls in some container like `std::vector`
- updating balls in the container at the same time
